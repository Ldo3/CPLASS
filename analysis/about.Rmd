CPLASS (Continuous Piecewise-Linear Approximation via Stochastic Search) is a computational framework for detecting changes in velocity within multidimensional time-series data.
Unlike conventional changepoint detection algorithms that focus on mean shifts, CPLASS identifies changes in slope (velocity) while enforcing continuity constraints across segments â€” making it particularly suited for complex, continuous processes such as intracellular transport dynamics.
